# **grc4ciso (GRC + XDR + GPT + ZT)**

### **Introduction**

grc4ciso integrates GRC, XDR, Zero Trust and GPT cybersecurity capabilities into a unified Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

This platform provides you:

- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (**GRC**): this is a community module hosted by OWASP projects https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-it-grc 
- Extended Detection and Response (**XDR**): endpoint security, configuration assessment, malware detection, file integrity monitoring, threat Intelligence, log data analysis, vulnerability detection, security operations, incident response, regulatory compliance, cloud security, container security.
- **GPT** assistant: GPT virtual CISO assistant integrated into the GRC module to provide you advise about cybersecurity activities, the GPT-4 assistant is also integrated into the XDR module to provide you information about the endpoints connected and alerts.
- **Zero Trust**: provide you the required components to implement a zero trust overlay network to protect web applications and services.

**With this platform you can get the power of these cybersecurity tools into a single SaaS platform!!**

## **GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance)**

Visit https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-it-grc to know the basic features of GRC module.

## **XDR**

XDR functionalities are based on wazuh platform, Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

**With grc4ciso you can increase the power of this tool, because you can analize the data generated by the XDR with GPT-4, and you can register the incidents identified, define containment and recovery actions from an attack.**
**Having all these functionalities in the same platform give you more capabilities to protect your IT systems combining GRC + GPT + XDR + Zero Trust capabilities.**

## **GPT**

**grc4ciso** integrates a **GPT assistant** that is trained to advised you on Cybersecurity activities, so you have a virtual CISO helping you to manage cybersecurity activities all time you need it.

This assistant can provide you information about your GRC profile (strategic risks, risk factors, controls, complicance, IT assets, threat scenarios).

Also if you are using the **XDR** module, the assistant can give you information about the endpoints that are connected to your **XDR**, so, you can for example ask the **grc4ciso GPT assistant** to summarize the main vulnerabilities you have in your systems, so you can take needed actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
