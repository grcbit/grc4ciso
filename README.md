**grc4ciso** integrates the following cybersecurity capabilities into a unified Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform:
- Extended Detection and Response (**XDR**).
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (**GRC**).
- **Zero Trust** components to protect web applications and services (**ZT**).

### **GPT-4**

**grc4ciso** integrates a **GPT assistant** that is trained to advised you on Cybersecurity activities, so you have a virtual CISO helping you to manage cybersecurity activities all time you need it.

Also if you are using the **XDR** module, the assistant can give you information about the endpoints that are connected to your **XDR**, so, you can for example ask the **grc4ciso GPT assistant** to summarize the main vulnerabilities you have in your systems, so you can take needed actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

You can also ask to grc4ciso GPT to create a threat scenario based on vulnerabilities identified and ask for recommendations to mitigate risks.

XDR GPT Assistant Examples:

- Show me the list of agents that are integrated to the XDR.

### **XDR**

XDR functionalities are based on wazuh platform, Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

**With grc4ciso you can increase the power of this tool, because you can analize the data generated by the XDR with GPT-4, and you can register the incidents identified, define containment and recovery actions from an attack.**
**Having all these functionalities in the same platform give more capabilities to protect your data combining GRC + GPT + XDR + Zero Trust camabilities.**
