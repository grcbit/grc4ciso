# **grc4ciso (GRC + XDR + GPT + ZT)**

**grc4ciso** integrates the following cybersecurity capabilities into a unified Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform:
- Extended Detection and Response (**XDR**).
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (**GRC**).
- **Zero Trust** components to protect web applications and services (**ZT**).
- **GPT-4** assistant (**GPT**).

**With this platform you can get the power of these cybersecurity tools into a single SaaS platform!!**

### **GPT-4**

**grc4ciso** integrates a **GPT assistant** that is trained to advised you on Cybersecurity activities, so you have a virtual CISO helping you to manage cybersecurity activities all time you need it.

Also if you are using the **XDR** module, the assistant can give you information about the endpoints that are connected to your **XDR**, so, you can for example ask the **grc4ciso GPT assistant** to summarize the main vulnerabilities you have in your systems, so you can take needed actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

The information you can get from GPT-XDR are the following (prompts examples):

- Show me the list of agents that are integrated to the XDR.

- Show me the vulnerabilities of the agent {agent_id}.

- Show me the configuration of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the key of the agent {agent_id}.
- Summarize the operating systems of the agents.
- Summarize the status of the agents.
- Show me the CISCAT (Center for Internet Security Configuration Assessment Tool) scan results of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me ports open of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the vulnerabilities of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the packages that are installed in the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the operating system of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the network information of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the hotfixes installed in the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the hardware information of the agent {agent_id}.
- Show me the results of the configuration assessment of the agent {agent_id}

This functionality is integrated into the free grc4ciso version, but to make the most of it, you have to integrate the XDR also.

### **GRC**

With this module you can comply with ISO 27001:2022 and PCI requirements, also you can implement an Information Security Management System, execute IT Risk, control design activities and more.

Some functionalities in this module are: 

- The platform provide you with the 93 ISO controls already loaded, security attributues, security concepts, categories, so you basically need to complete the statement aplicability to show an Information Security Management System implemented in your organization.

- You can get reports and charts about the Information Security Management System.

- <img width="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/0eda3765-5550-434c-818f-2a0102d87bee">

- You can evaluate risks using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Score System) calculator integrated in the risk module.

- <img width="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/06981015-c0d8-42b3-9a15-f359ed1a943d">

- You can automatically launch security awareness campaigns by email and track users response to it.

- <img width="948" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/592bee33-097a-459c-8311-785e4e790d66">

- You can plan onboarding and offboarding employee security activities.
- You Can't Protect What You Don't Know, so in the GRC module you can register IT providers, IT components, IT systems, processess and critical data, so you can evaluate risk and desing controls over such components to protect you data.
- You can registers cybersecurity incidents to ensure adequate treatment.
- Define the roles needed for you Information Security System.
- You can plan and track ISO27001, CIS Controls, and other cybersecurity implementations.
- And moe.

**This module is free, so you can download it or request us to create an instance for you, we recommend you to integrate the other modules (XDR + GPT + ZT) to get the most of it.**

To use the other modules you can get a suscription based on the number of endpoints you integrate whether in the XDR or ZeroTrust module. Please visit https://grc4ciso/shop



### **XDR**

XDR functionalities are based on wazuh platform, Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

With grc4ciso can increase the power of this tool, because you can analize the data generated by the XDR with GPT-4, and you can register the incidents identified and the actions taken to contain and recover from an attack.

The XDR is provided with an Anomally detection plugin base on AI Forest algorithm


### **ZeroTrust**

ZeroTrust functionalities are based on OpenZiti platform

With



### DEMO

Maybe when you try to access the XDR and ZeroTrus functionalities, you will see an error page, it is normal because this modules works in a Zero Trust network, so in order to access XDR and ZeroTrust functionalities please request us a ZeroTrust Token.
