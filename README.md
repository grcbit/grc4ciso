# **grc4ciso (GRC + XDR + GPT + ZT)**

### **Introduction**

grc4ciso integrates GRC, XDR, Zero Trust and GPT cybersecurity capabilities into a unified Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.

This platform provides you:

- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (**GRC**): this is a community module hosted by OWASP projects https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-it-grc 
- Extended Detection and Response (**XDR**): endpoint security, configuration assessment, malware detection, file integrity monitoring, threat Intelligence, log data analysis, vulnerability detection, security operations, incident response, regulatory compliance, cloud security, container security.
- **GPT-4** assistant: GPT virtual CISO assistant integrated into the GRC module to provide you advise about cybersecurity activities, the GPT-4 assistant is also integrated into the XDR module to provide you information about the endpoints connected and alerts.
- **Zero Trust**: provide you the required components to implement a zero trust overlay network to protect web applications and services.

**With this platform you can get the power of these cybersecurity tools into a single SaaS platform!!**

## **GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance)**

Visit https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-it-grc to know the basic features of GRC module.

### **Aditional enterprise features**

### **Compliance**

Pre-mapped ISO27001:2022 controls so you can focus on statement of applicability.

Also stay compliant with the following frameworks:

- PCI DSS 4.0
- NIST 800-53-V1
- CIS Controls V8
- NIST CSF 2.0
- NIST CSF 1.1
- OWASP ASVS 4.0.3
- You can load more frameworks if you need it.

### **Employee Awareness**

- You can launch security awareness campaigns, and track the user's response.

- Also you can plan onboarding and offboarding employee security activities.


## **XDR**

XDR functionalities are based on wazuh platform, Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

**With grc4ciso you can increase the power of this tool, because you can analize the data generated by the XDR with GPT-4, and you can register the incidents identified, define containment and recovery actions from an attack.**
**Having all these functionalities in the same platform give more capabilities to protect your data combining GRC + GPT + XDR + Zero Trust camabilities.**

## **GPT-4**

**grc4ciso** integrates a **GPT assistant** that is trained to advised you on Cybersecurity activities, so you have a virtual CISO helping you to manage cybersecurity activities all time you need it.

Also if you are using the **XDR** module, the assistant can give you information about the endpoints that are connected to your **XDR**, so, you can for example ask the **grc4ciso GPT assistant** to summarize the main vulnerabilities you have in your systems, so you can take needed actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

You can also ask to grc4ciso GPT to create a threat scenario based on vulnerabilities identified and ask for recommendations to mitigate risks.
