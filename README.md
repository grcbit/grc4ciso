### **GPT-4**

**grc4ciso** integrates a **GPT assistant** that is trained to advised you on Cybersecurity activities, so you have a virtual CISO helping you to manage cybersecurity activities all time you need it.

Also if you are using the **XDR** module, the assistant can give you information about the endpoints that are connected to your **XDR**, so, you can for example ask the **grc4ciso GPT assistant** to summarize the main vulnerabilities you have in your systems, so you can take needed actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.

You can also ask to grc4cisoc GPT to create a threat scenario based on vulnerabilities identified and ask for recommendations to mitigate risks.

XDR GPT Assistant Examples:

- Show me the list of agents that are integrated to the XDR.

### **GRC**

With this module you can comply with ISO 27001:2022 and PCI requirements, also you can implement an Information Security Management System, execute IT Risk, control design activities and more.

Some functionalities in this module are: 

- The platform provide you with the 93 ISO controls already loaded, security attributues, security concepts, categories, so you basically need to complete the statement aplicability to show an Information Security Management System implemented in your organization.

- <img width="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/9c774967-cb35-4498-bf1e-1da562b2dfbc">
- <img width="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/2e34a7ba-8a81-469d-b9ac-b5b368f8443d">

- You can get reports and charts about the Information Security Management System.

- <img width="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/0eda3765-5550-434c-818f-2a0102d87bee">

- You can evaluate risks using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Score System) calculator integrated in the risk module.

- <img width="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/06981015-c0d8-42b3-9a15-f359ed1a943d">

- You can automatically launch security awareness campaigns by email and track users response to it.

- <img width="948" alt="image" src="https://github.com/grcbit/grc4ciso/assets/60721087/592bee33-097a-459c-8311-785e4e790d66">

### **XDR**

XDR functionalities are based on wazuh platform, Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.

Wazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.

**With grc4ciso you can increase the power of this tool, because you can analize the data generated by the XDR with GPT-4, and you can register the incidents identified, define containment and recovery actions from an attack.**
**Having all these functionalities in the same platform give more capabilities to protect your data combining GRC + GPT + XDR + Zero Trust camabilities.**

### **ZeroTrust**

grc4ciso provides you all the needed components to create a Zero Trust network to protect you web applications and services, it is based on the openziti platform. OpenZiti is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust networking principles directly into any application. The project provides all the pieces required to implement a zero trust overlay network and provides all the tools necessary to integrate zero trust into your existing solutions.
